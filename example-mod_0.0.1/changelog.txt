Version: 0.0.1 - Date format notes
Date: 2020/05/27
  Info:
    - Including the "Date: " line is entirely optional. If you don't care about including release dates, just leave it out entirely.
    - The exact format of the date string in the "Date: " line is up to you.
    - The date format listed in example version 0.0.0 below (DD. MM. YYYY) is the one used by Wube in the base mod changelog, but you do not have to follow this.
    - The most common date formats that i've seen used are DD. MM. YYYY (Wube's) or YYYY-MM-DD. I recommend using one of these two, but it's your mod, do whatever you want to.
